3. The collaborator, makes a copy of shared directory, downloads this to their local computer and makes changes. 

4. The collaborator that sends the shared directory back to the owner who can approve changes and merge or reply back or ignore, or ... 

5. The owner can then pull the directory from remote to their local machine and then back into obsidian as desired.
