The things you most want, your aspirations, are guarded by a hydra. If you chop one head off, two more emerge. The hydra symbolizes the complexity of life. 

RAARR gives you a way to get past the hydra and make your aspirations come true.  Think of RAARR (R-DoubleA-DoubleR) as your battle cry. 

Each of us is the hero in our own story. We confront the hydra which is the chaos of life. The hydra is the natural opposition that lies between us and our aspirations. We strive mightily against it, but more and valiant efforts are not the way to win, for with every head that is cut off, two more take its place. The present hero that cannot defeat the hydra needs to grow into the future hero that can. This often happens in three ways or a combination, 1) Finding hidden wisdom or knowledge, 2) additional tools or tech, or 3) growth (hero improves capacity). The hydra is the ordeal that stands in your way beyond which is the treasure. In every story, there is an element of sacrifice for the hero required to overcome, and a test so severe that it requires the upmost of the hero.  Therefore, the hero's battle cry is "RAARR" the thing on their lips that leads them into victory in the battle of life, to overcome chaos and achieve their aspirations. It is the hidden knowledge (RAARR), the tool (obsidian and the complexity problem and COG), and leads to growth (you improve your capacity by using). Thus, the individual succeeds in their ageless hero quest of conquering and achievement of their highest aspiration (treasure).   

We help the hero hope and win...
