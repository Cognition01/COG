# Follow Ups: 2023-03-22

Overview: Obsidian does not use standard markdown. Thus, GitHub  sometimes does not render files in a readable way. Thus, I'm rewriting some info from the 2023-03-20 meeting so that it is more usable. In addition, I've updated RARR and added info about embedding notes in notes. 

## Learning COG

First, learn how to use Github by taking the following actions. 

1. Get a Personal Access Token from Github. 
     See the document  Personal Access Token.md

2. Make a clone of a GitHub; see the document Clone.md. 

## Updates on RAARR

see the file

RAARR is Roles, Aspirations, Actions, Reflections, Rewards.md

## Notes Embedded in Notes

A note is embedded in another note by using      
`![[File Name]]`

This also works for linking to a heading as follows:     
`![[File Name#Heading]]`

For more details and examples, see [Obsidian's Documentation of Notes Embedded in Notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embedding+files)
